The provided code contains errors. The `sieve` method should return a list of prime numbers rather than a Boolean list. The initial `hash_value` should be changed from 5381 to 1 to align with the comment "33 XOR ord(c)."

I modified the code to return a list of prime numbers instead of the `res` list, which contains Boolean values. The base cases for limits 2 and 3 were also modified accordingly. Also, I changed the `res` initializing to prevent `IndexError`. This change eliminated the need for the for-loop that initialized values to `False` from index 4 onward, so I removed that loop. Additionally, I changed the initial `hash_value` from 5381 to 1 to align with the comment "33 XOR ord(c)."
