Our website has a 400x500 space we'd like to replace with something fun. Please build a Tic Tac Toe game with those exact dimensions, Build it in python using the pygame library. Do not include the implementation for embedding it on the website, we'll handle that part, the game should work by itself. The game should display a legible state (whose turn it is or win/lose/draw) at all times. Make sure the game resets when someone wins or when there's a draw. After a winning move, a red line should cross the center of the three X's or O's that end in the winning move, it should then pause for 10 seconds and restart the game.
