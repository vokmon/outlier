The comment about the screen height is cut off. I think the `time.sleep` function is intended for the pause during each game reset and therefore shouldn't be called in the `game_initiating_window` method. The game status text is incorrectly drawn in the center of the game area instead of in the status bar (at the bottom). The diagonal winning lines are pink instead of red, and they don't span the full width and height for no clear reason. In the `drawXO` method, x-axis values are used for the y-axis and vice versa; while this mistake doesn't directly affect the output, it could lead to confusion in future modifications. Additionally, X's and O's aren't drawn in the center of the boxes. In the `reset_game` method, the sleep time is set to 3 seconds instead of the 10 seconds requested by the user. Furthermore, when resetting the game, the `current_winner` variable should be reset before redrawing the game window. Currently, the wrong order causes the status bar to show the previous game's winner instead of "X's Turn."


To resolve all the issues I mentioned earlier, I first completed the comment that seemed cut off. Then, I removed the `sleep` method call from the `game_initiating_window` method. I corrected the calculation logic so that the status text is now placed correctly. For the diagonal winning lines, I changed the color to red and adjusted the start and end points to span the full width and height. In the `drawXO` method, I properly corrected the x- and y-axis variable usage and modified the values so that the X's and O's are centered in their boxes. Finally, in the `reset_game` method, I changed the sleep time from 3 to 10 and moved the `current_winner` resetting statement to occur before `game_initiating_window`. Besides the code, I also fixed some typos in the Instructions section following the code.
